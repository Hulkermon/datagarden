# 🌈 Datagarden ✨

A fun little Data Visualization project based on a bunch of locational data on swiss citizens.

### How to run:
1. 🔧 Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org)
2. 📦 Run `corepack enable` to install yarn (may require admin privileges)
3. 🧶 Run `yarn` in root directory 
4. 🚀 Serve web-app with `yarn start` 
5. ⏳ Wait for the app to launch 
6. 👀 Check it out on [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

If the commands `corepack` or `yarn` aren't found, remember to restart your shell after the first two steps.

### Lots of data
All the data is stored in two.geojson files, which makes loading rather slow and unfortunately not super pretty.  
Although there is no progress bar (😦) you'll know the data has loaded once the intro animation plays and you see a bunch of beautiful 🔰 colors ✨ all over Switzerland.

### Presentation mode
When enabled, use the arrow keys (◀, ▶) to navigate through the animation keyframes.  
These keyframes simply pan through the data, focusing on some in my opinion interesting points.  
(This was intended to be used in a literal presentation, so if it doesn't make any sense... yeah.. I guess that's unfortunate)
